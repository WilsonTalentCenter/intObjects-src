Create an intelliJ project for this assignment to do the below(there will be no Mimir for this assignment):

/* for this assigment you are going to practice creating objects and calling methods

Although not needed you may want to look at

// create a Scanner object, passing in System.in as the parameter, called: console


//call the nextLine method on the console object.
//print the value that is returned by the method call
//call the next method on the console object.
//print the value that is returned by the method call
//call the nextLine method on the console object.
//print the value that is returned by the method call

//create a new ArrayList object called myList that contains integers using the line below:
ArrayList<Integer> myList = new ArrayList<>();

//call the add method on myList passing in the number 12
//print the result of the value returned by calling the size method on myList
//call the add method on myList passing in the number 14
//print the result of the value returned by calling the size method on myList
//print the result of the value returned by calling the get method on myList passing in 0 as the input
//print the result of the value returned by calling the get method on myList passing in 1 as the input
//call the set method on myList passing in 0 and 5 as the two inputs
//print the result of the value returned by calling the get method on myList passing in 0 as the input
//print the result of the value returned by calling the get method on myList passing in 1 as the input
//call the clear method on myList
//print the result of the value returned by calling the size method on myList


// create a Date object called currentDate
// create a Date object called anotherDate


// call the toString method on currentDate and put it into a string variable called curDateString
// print curDateString
// call the setTime method for anotherDate passing in 123478 as its input.
// call the before method on currentDate passing in anotherDate  put the returned value into a boolean variable called isBefore.  
// print the value of isBefore
